# Implementation

I took this opportunity to learn how to use LiveView - a new and exciting feature that the developers of Phoenix have introduced recently. Although it is not the cleanest code I have written - I hope I showed you that I know how to use Elixir's enviroment and I am excited about learning new technologies and advancement in my Elixir development.
